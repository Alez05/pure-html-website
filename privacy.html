  <h1>Privacy</h1>

  <p>
    We respect your privacy and promise to use any information we hold about you
    in a safe and responsible way. By shopping with us, you are agreeing to our
    Privacy Policy, in particular, our use of your information, as outlined
    below.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are the ‘controller’ of personal data we have collected about you as set
    out below. This includes personal data we use to verify your identity and
    confirm that you are at least 18 years of age (we cannot sell goods to you
    if you are below 18 years of age).
  </p>

  <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>
  <br />

  <p>
    The information we gather on our site falls into two categories: (1)
    personal data you supply when you become a member, order, complete a survey,
    post in a discussion forum, post news articles, or provide your email
    address, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through
    www.leafenvy.co.uk or other website we operate (‘Website’).
  </p>

  <h3>HOW AND WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>

  <p>
    All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. We take
    the security of your personal data very seriously. In particular we ensure
    that appropriate security measures are in place to protect your personal
    data. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
    completely secure and so we cannot guarantee the security of your data
    transmitted through the internet including through the Website; any
    transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we
    will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent
    unauthorised access.
  </p>

  <h3>YOUR RIGHTS</h3>

  <p>
    You have the right to know if we process any personal data about you and, if
    we are, with certain limitations, to a copy of that personal data. You also
    have the right to ask us to remove or correct any of that personal data that
    is inaccurate, to object to certain processing and to withdraw any consent
    you may have given us for any processing of your personal data. You also
    have the right to ask us to restrict processing certain of your personal
    data, to erase your personal data, and to ‘port’ certain of your personal
    data to you or another provider, provided in each case that we have such
    data and certain conditions are met.
