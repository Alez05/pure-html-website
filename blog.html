    <h1>Introduction to Biophilic Design</h1>
    <p>
      Biophilic design or Biophilia (our innate love of nature) is the concept
      of infusing interior design with nature to create an environment that
      evokes feelings of happiness and sere...
    </p>

    <h3>What is Biophilia?</h3>

    <p>
      Biophilia is our desire to connect with the natural world, which is
      especially more prominent when we live in buildings without much direct
      contact to nature. It is suggested that our innate attraction to plants
      has been built through hundreds of thousands of years of living in
      agrarian environments. Being around nature is therefore sympathetic to our
      DNA and overall health & wellbeing.
    </p>

    <h3>Bringing Biophilic Design to your Home</h3>

    <p>
      Through biophilic design, we can introduce plants to our homes & offices
      to create spaces full of life and energy. Surrounding ourselves with
      plants is the perfect way to connect with nature whilst also creating a
      beautiful interior garden. Bringing the outside in does not only improve
      our interiors aesthetically, but studies show that it promotes an array of
      emotional, physical and mental health benefits, from air purification to
      boosting productivity as well as creativity, and reducing stress.
