      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <h3>Falling in love with biophilic design</h3>
      <p>
        Leaf Envy’s roots have flourished alongside founder Beth’s personal love
        affair with the botanical world. Transforming her apartment into a
        foliage-filled retreat from which to escape to, Beth discovered how
        difficult it was to navigate the world of plant care, and find unusual
        plants and perfectly-fitting pots that matched her style. Leaf Envy is
        that vision - encapsulating all three aspects in one.

      <h1>From canal boat to HQ</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>Born and bred in Hackney, London</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Leaf Envy started doing pop-ups on a boat along Regents Canal. Quickly
        outgrowing this floating jungle, she joined Google for StartUps Female
        Founder program in 2019. Since then, we’ve been growing fast (like our
        plants) ever since! Today we work hard to curate a collection of
        interesting plant species paired with bespoke pots. We are proud to be
        the destination for budding plant enthusiasts nationwide, and love
        nothing more than going on that journey with our customers.
