<h1>Bringing spaces to life with plants in our jam</h1>

<h3>
  We work with internal teams looking for plants for their office, restaurant,
  event or space, as well as property developers, architects & interior
  designers. Our Plant Design team will create a scheme to suit your
  requirements whether that be outdoor, indoor, real or artificial.

    <h3>Install</h3>
    <p>
      Our Projects team will deliver and install your scheme at a time that
      suits you. We'll pot, prep and prune your plants prior to arrival and
      ensure they are well misted and watered before we go. All our plant
      displays are potted up with best practice and longevity in mind.

    <h3>After care</h3>

      Professional aftercare is available on request and bespoke to each plant
      design project. Just let us know you'd like to discuss this option too and
